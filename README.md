- [MATLAB Professional Plots](#matlab-professional-plots)
  - [Single plots](#single-plots)
  - [Multiple sub-plots](#multiple-sub-plots)


This script is to help researchers and alike produce manuscript-worthy plots in MATLAB without having to do too much work.

it has 3 main components
- sample plotting practises
- maximizing plot area using subplotter function
- adding zoom sub-axis to your plot for magnification

## Single plots
An example of a single plot with zoomed axes is shown below
