- [Zoom plots](#zoom-plots)


This script is to help researchers and alike produce manuscript-worthy plots in MATLAB without having to do too much work.

it has 3 main components
- sample plotting practises
- maximizing plot area using subplotter function
- adding zoom sub-axis to your plot for magnification

## Single plots
An example of a single plot with zoomed axes is shown below

## Multiple sub-plots
Additionally, an example of multiple sub-plots is shown below

# Zoom plots
There is a function written by Dr. Rahimi to help quickly and if needed interactively add zoom plots to your existing axes.

Below is a quick animation of the functionality of the function
